#OOP in python is used to represent real world concept and entities
#class is templates or blueprint for creating object
#Class defines about the properties and methods that the object should have

#Object is an instance of a class and contains its own data

# For example:
#     If fruit is a class and apple, banana, mango etc are the objects
#     The commonn properties that object may contain color, taste, cost etc.
#     The individual obejects has their own properties and the properties are defined on class 
#     From class objects creates their individual Data.

# So there is no need to make individual data and functions for inividual objects and it makes program simple and easier
